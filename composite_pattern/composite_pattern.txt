Composite Method is a Structural Design Pattern which describes a group of objects that is treated the same way as a single
instance of the same type of the objects. The purpose of the Composite Method is to Compose objects into Tree type structures
to represent the whole-partial hierarchies.

One of the main advantages of using the Composite Method is that first, it allows you to compose the objects into the
Tree Structure and then work with these structures as an individual object or an entity.
